3rd Grade CA History Common Core Standards: [
    Continuity and Change

Students in grade three learn more about our connections to the past and the ways in
which particularly local, but also regional and national, government and traditions have
developed and left their marks on current society, providing common memories. Emphasis is on the physical and cultural landscape of California, including the study of
American Indians, the subsequent arrival of immigrants, and the impact they have had
in forming the character of our contemporary society.

1. Identify geographical features in their local region (e.g., deserts, mountains, valleys,
hills, coastal areas, oceans, lakes).
2. Trace the ways in which people have used the resources of the local region and modified the physical environment (e.g., a dam constructed upstream changed a river or
