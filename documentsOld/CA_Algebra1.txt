The Real Number System N-RN
Extend the properties of exponents to rational exponents.
1. Explain how the definition of the meaning of rational exponents follows from extending the properties of integer exponents
to those values, allowing for a notation for radicals in terms of rational exponents. For example, we define 51/3 to be the
cube root of 5 because we want (51/3)3
 = 5(1/3)3 to hold, so (51/3)3 must equal 5.
2. Rewrite expressions involving radicals and rational exponents using the properties of exponents.
Use properties of rational and irrational numbers.

number is irrational; and that the product of a nonzero rational number and an irrational number is irrational.

Functions
Interpreting Functions F-IF
Understand the concept of a function and use function notation. [Learn as general principle; focus on linear and
exponential and on arithmetic and geometric sequences.]
1. Understand that a function from one set (called the domain) to another set (called the range) assigns to each element
of the domain exactly one element of the range. If f is a function and x is an element of its domain, then f(x) denotes the
output of f corresponding to the input x. The graph of f is the graph of the equation y = f(x).
2. Use function notation, evaluate functions for inputs in their domains, and interpret statements that use function notation
in terms of a context.
3. Recognize that sequences are functions, sometimes defined recursively, whose domain is a subset of the integers.
For example, the Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively by f(0) = f(1) = 1, f(n + 1) = f(n) + f(n − 1) for n ≥ 1.

symmetries; end behavior; and periodicity. 
5. Relate the domain of a function to its graph and, where applicable, to the quantitative relationship it describes. For example,
if the function h gives the number of person-hours it takes to assemble n engines in a factory, then the positive integers
would be an appropriate domain for the function. 

a. Use the process of factoring and completing the square in a quadratic function to show zeros, extreme values, and
symmetry of the graph, and interpret these in terms of a context.
b. Use the properties of exponents to interpret expressions for exponential functions. For example, identify percent rate of
change in functions such as y = (1.02)t
, y = (0.97)t
, y = (1.01)12t, and y = (1.2)t/10, and classify them as representing
exponential growth or decay.
9. Compare properties of two functions each represented in a different way (algebraically, graphically, numerically in tables, or
by verbal descriptions). For example, given a graph of one quadratic function and an algebraic expression for another, say
which has the larger maximum.

of a cooling body by adding a constant function to a decaying exponential, and relate these functions to the model. 
2. Write arithmetic and geometric sequences both recursively and with an explicit formula, use them to model situations, and
translate between the two forms. 

A system of linear equations is usually a set of two linear equations with two variables.
\[x+y=5\] and 
\[2x-y=1\] are both linear equations with two variables.
When considered together, they form a system of linear equations.
A linear equation with two variables has an infinite number of solutions (for example, consider how 
\[(0,5)\], 
\[(1,4)\], 
\[(2,3)\], etc. are all solutions to the equation 
\[x+y=5\]). However, systems of two linear equations with two variables can have a single solution that satisfies both solutions.
\[(2,3)\] is the only solution to both 
\[x+y=5\] and 
\[2x-y=1\].
In this lesson, we'll:
Look at two ways to solve systems of linear equations algebraically: substitution and elimination.
Look at systems of linear equations graphically to help us understand when systems of linear equations have one solution, no solutions, or infinitely many solutions.
Explore algebraic methods of identifying the number of solutions that exist for systems with two linear equations.
How does substitution work?
Our goal when solving a system of equations is to reduce two equations with two variables down to a single equation with one variable. Since each equation in the system has two variables, one way to reduce the number of variables in an equation is to substitute an expression for a variable.
Consider the following example:
 
\[\begin{aligned}
x &= 2y \\\\
x+y&=3
\end{aligned}\]
In a system of equations, both equations are simultaneously true. In other words, since the first equation tells us that 
\[x\] is equal to 
\[2y\], the 
\[x\] in the second equation is also equal to 
\[2y\]. Therefore, we can plug in 
\[2y\] as a substitute for 
\[x\] in the second equation:
 
\[\begin{aligned}
x+y &= 3\\\\
(2y)+y &= 3 \\\\
3y &= 3
\end{aligned}\]
From here, we can solve the equation 
\[3y=3\], then use the value of 
\[y\] to calculate 
\[x\]. [Show me more!]
To solve a system of equations using substitution:
Isolate one of the two variables in one of the equations.
Substitute the expression that is equal to the isolated variable from Step 1 into the other equation. This should result in a linear equation with only one variable.
Solve the linear equation for the remaining variable.
Use the solution of Step 3 to calculate the value of the other variable in the system by using one of the original equations.

How does elimination work?
Our goal when solving a system of equations is to reduce two equations with two variables down to a single equation with one variable. Since each equation in the system has two variables, one way to reduce the number of variables is to add or subtract the two equations in the system to cancel out, or eliminate, one of the variables.
Consider the following system of equations:
 
\[\begin{aligned}
3x-y &= 7 \\\\
2x+y&=8
\end{aligned}\]
Recall that when we're solving equations, we can perform the same operations to both sides of the equation and maintain the equality. Since the second equation tells us that 
\[2x+y\] is equal to 
\[8\], we can add 
\[2x+y\] to the left side of the first equation, add 
\[8\] to the right side of the first equation, and maintain the equality:
 
\[\begin{aligned}
3x\purpleD{-y} &= 7 \\
{+}~2x\purpleD{+y}&=8\\
\hline\\
5x+0 &=15
\end{aligned}\]
Notice that the 
\[y\]-terms cancel out and are eliminated as a result of adding the two equations. When solving systems of equations using elimination, we're always looking for opportunities to cancel out terms.
If two terms have the opposite coefficients like in the system above (
\[-y\] and 
\[y\]), we can add the two equations to cancel the terms.
If two terms have the same coefficients, we can subtract the two equations to cancel the terms.
From here, we can solve the equation 
\[5x=15\], then use the value of 
\[x\] to calculate 
\[y\]. [Show me more!]
Sometimes, the system of equations does not have coefficients that readily cancel out. Consider this example:
 
\[\begin{aligned}
3x-y &= 7 \\\\
x+2y&=21
\end{aligned}\]
In this case, we need to find ways to match a pair of coefficients by rewriting one of the equations. There are two ways to do this.
Option 1: We can set the system up for eliminating the 
\[y\]-terms through addition by multiplying both sides of the first equation by 
\[2\].
 
\[\begin{aligned}
(3x-y)\purpleD{\cdot2} &= 7\purpleD{\cdot2} \\\\
6x-2y &= 14
\end{aligned}\]
From here, we can add the second equation to eliminate the 
\[y\]-terms:
 
\[\begin{aligned}
6x\purpleD{-2y} &= 14 \\
{+}~~x\purpleD{+2y}&=21\\
\hline\\
7x+0 &=35
\end{aligned}\]
[Show me more!]
Option 2: We can also set the system up for eliminating the 
\[x\]-terms through subtraction by multiplying both sides of the second equation by 
\[3\].
 
\[\begin{aligned}
(x+2y)\purpleD{\cdot3} &= 21\purpleD{\cdot3} \\\\
3x+6y &= 63
\end{aligned}\]
From here, we can subtract the equation from the first equation to eliminate the 
\[x\]-terms:
 
\[\begin{aligned}
3x\purpleD{-~~y} &= 7 \\
{-}3x\purpleD{+6y}&=63\\
\hline\\
0-7y &=-56
\end{aligned}\]
[Show me more!]
To solve a system of equations using elimination:
Identify a pair of terms in the system that have both the same variable and coefficients with the same magnitude (ex: 
\[2x\] and 
\[2x\], or 
\[3y\] and 
\[-3y\]). If necessary, rewrite one or both equations so that a pair of terms have both the same variable and coefficients with the same magnitude.
Add or subtract the two equations in the system to eliminate the terms identified in Step 1. This should result in a linear equation with only one variable.
Solve the linear equation to obtain a value for the variable.
Now that you have figured out the value of one variable, plug that value into either equation to find the value of the other variable.
