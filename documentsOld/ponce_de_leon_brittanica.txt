Juan Ponce de León was an early Spanish explorer of the Americas. He was the first European to visit Florida. He is also famous for his association with the legendary Fountain of Youth.

Ponce de León was born in about 1460 in the Spanish province of León. He may have sailed to the Americas with Christopher Columbus in 1493. In 1502 he helped to conquer the island of Hispaniola, in the Caribbean Sea. In 1508 he founded Puerto Rico’s earliest European settlement. In 1509 he became governor of the island.

In March 1513 Ponce de León left Puerto Rico to continue to search for new lands. He may also have been looking for an island he had heard about. It was said that a spring on this island flowed with water that kept people young. In April 1513 Ponce de León landed on the mainland of North America, though he thought he was on an island. He named the territory Florida.

Ponce de León had landed near what is now Saint Augustine, in the northeastern part of the state. He did not find the spring, so from there he traveled south along the coast. He continued through the chain of islands called the Florida Keys to Florida’s west coast. On the way he discovered the Gulf Stream, a warm ocean current that flows northward.

Ponce de León returned to Spain in 1514. The king gave him permission to start colonies in the areas he had visited. In 1521 Ponce de León sailed again to Florida. He was wounded in an attack by Native Americans. His crew took him to Havana, Cuba, where he died.
