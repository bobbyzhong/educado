8th grade CA Common Core Math: [
    The Number System 8.NS
Know that there are numbers that are not rational, and approximate them by rational numbers.
1. Know that numbers that are not rational are called irrational. Understand informally that every number has a decimal
expansion; for rational numbers show that the decimal expansion repeats eventually, and convert a decimal expansion
which repeats eventually into a rational number.
2. Use rational approximations of irrational numbers to compare the size of irrational numbers, locate them approximately on a
number line diagram, and estimate the value of expressions (e.g.,π2
). For example, by truncating the decimal expansion of
√2, show that √2 is between 1 and 2, then between 1.4 and 1.5, and explain how to continue on to get better approximations.
Expressions and Equations 8.EE
Work with radicals and integer exponents.
1. Know and apply the properties of integer exponents to generate equivalent numerical expressions. For example,
32
 × 3–5 = 3–3 = 1/33
 = 1/27.
2. Use square root and cube root symbols to represent solutions to equations of the form x2
 = p and x3
 = p, where p is a
positive rational number. Evaluate square roots of small perfect squares and cube roots of small perfect cubes. Know that
√2 is irrational.
3. Use numbers expressed in the form of a single digit times an integer power of 10 to estimate very large or very small
quantities, and to express how many times as much one is than the other. For example, estimate the population of the
United States as 3 × 108
 and the population of the world as 7 × 109
, and determine that the world population is more
than 20 times larger.
4. Perform operations with numbers expressed in scientific notation, including problems where both decimal and scientific
notation are used. Use scientific notation and choose units of appropriate size for measurements of very large or very small
quantities (e.g., use millimeters per year for seafloor spreading). Interpret scientific notation that has been generated by
technology.
Understand the connections between proportional relationships, lines, and linear equations.
5. Graph proportional relationships, interpreting the unit rate as the slope of the graph. Compare two different proportional
relationships represented in different ways. For example, compare a distance-time graph to a distance-time equation to
determine which of two moving objects has greater speed.
6. Use similar triangles to explain why the slope m is the same between any two distinct points on a non-vertical line in the
coordinate plane; derive the equation y = mx for a line through the origin and the equation y = mx + b for a line intercepting
the vertical axis at b.
Analyze and solve linear equations and pairs of simultaneous linear equations.
7. Solve linear equations in one variable.
a. Give examples of linear equations in one variable with one solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solutions. Show
which of these possibilities is the case by successively transforming the given equation into simpler forms, until an
equivalent equation of the form x = a, a = a, or a = b results (where a and b are different numbers).
b. Solve linear equations with rational number coefficients, including equations whose solutions require expanding
expressions using the distributive property and collecting like terms.

8. Analyze and solve pairs of simultaneous linear equations.
a. Understand that solutions to a system of two linear equations in two variables correspond to points of intersection of
their graphs, because points of intersection satisfy both equations simultaneously.
b. Solve systems of two linear equations in two variables algebraically, and estimate solutions by graphing the equations.
Solve simple cases by inspection. For example, 3x + 2y = 5 and 3x + 2y = 6 have no solution because 3x + 2y cannot
simultaneously be 5 and 6.
c. Solve real-world and mathematical problems leading to to linear equations in two variables. For example, given
coordinates for two pairs of points, determine whether the line through the first pair of points intersects the line through
the second pair.
Functions 8.F
Define, evaluate, and compare functions.
1. Understand that a function is a rule that assigns to each input exactly one output. The graph of a function is the set of
ordered pairs consisting of an input and the corresponding output.1
2. Compare properties of two functions each represented in a different way (algebraically, graphically, numerically in tables,
or by verbal descriptions). For example, given a linear function represented by a table of values and a linear function
represented by an algebraic expression, determine which function has the greater rate of change.
3. Interpret the equation y = mx + b as defining a linear function, whose graph is a straight line; give examples of functions
that are not linear. For example, the function A = s2
 giving the area of a square as a function of its side length is not linear
because its graph contains the points (1,1), (2,4) and (3,9), which are not on a straight line.
Use functions to model relationships between quantities.
4. Construct a function to model a linear relationship between two quantities. Determine the rate of change and initial value
of the function from a description of a relationship or from two (x, y) values, including reading these from a table or from a
graph. Interpret the rate of change and initial value of a linear function in terms of the situation it models, and in terms of
its graph or a table of values.
5. Describe qualitatively the functional relationship between two quantities by analyzing a graph (e.g., where the function is
increasing or decreasing, linear or nonlinear). Sketch a graph that exhibits the qualitative features of a function that has
been described verbally.
Geometry 8.G
Understand congruence and similarity using physical models, transparencies, or geometry software.
1. Verify experimentally the properties of rotations, reflections, and translations:
a. Lines are taken to lines, and line segments to line segments of the same length.
b. Angles are taken to angles of the same measure.
c. Parallel lines are taken to parallel lines.
1. Function notation is not required in grade 8.

2. Understand that a two-dimensional figure is congruent to another if the second can be obtained from the first by a sequence
of rotations, reflections, and translations; given two congruent figures, describe a sequence that exhibits the congruence
between them.
3. Describe the effect of dilations, translations, rotations, and reflections on two-dimensional figures using coordinates.
4. Understand that a two-dimensional figure is similar to another if the second can be obtained from the first by a sequence
of rotations, reflections, translations, and dilations; given two similar two-dimensional figures, describe a sequence that
exhibits the similarity between them.
5. Use informal arguments to establish facts about the angle sum and exterior angle of triangles, about the angles created
when parallel lines are cut by a transversal, and the angle-angle criterion for similarity of triangles. For example, arrange
three copies of the same triangle so that the sum of the three angles appears to form a line, and give an argument in
terms of transversals why this is so.
Understand and apply the Pythagorean Theorem.
6. Explain a proof of the Pythagorean Theorem and its converse.
7. Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to determine unknown side lengths in right triangles in real-world and mathematical
problems in two and three dimensions.
8. Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find the distance between two points in a coordinate system.
Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving volume of cylinders, cones, and spheres.
9. Know the formulas for the volumes of cones, cylinders, and spheres and use them to solve real-world and mathematical
problems.
Statistics and Probability 8.SP
Investigate patterns of association in bivariate data.
1. Construct and interpret scatter plots for bivariate measurement data to investigate patterns of association between two
quantities. Describe patterns such as clustering, outliers, positive or negative association, linear association, and nonlinear
association.
2. Know that straight lines are widely used to model relationships between two quantitative variables. For scatter plots that
suggest a linear association, informally fit a straight line, and informally assess the model fit by judging the closeness of the
data points to the line.
3. Use the equation of a linear model to solve problems in the context of bivariate measurement data, interpreting the slope
and intercept. For example, in a linear model for a biology experiment, interpret a slope of 1.5 cm/hr as meaning that an
additional hour of sunlight each day is associated with an additional 1.5 cm in mature plant height.
4. Understand that patterns of association can also be seen in bivariate categorical data by displaying frequencies and relative
frequencies in a two-way table. Construct and interpret a two-way table summarizing data on two categorical variables
collected from the same subjects. Use relative frequencies calculated for rows or columns to describe possible association
between the two variables. For example, collect data from students in your class on whether or not they have a curfew on
school nights and whether or not they have assigned chores at home. Is there evidence that those who have a curfew also
tend to have chores?
