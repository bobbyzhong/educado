addition to the specific treatment of milestones in California history, students examine
the state in the context of the rest of the nation, with an emphasis on the U.S. Constitution and the relationship between state and federal government.

features that define places and regions in California.
1. Explain and use the coordinate grid system of latitude and longitude to determine the
absolute locations of places in California and on Earth.
2. Distinguish between the North and South Poles; the equator and the prime meridian;
the tropics; and the hemispheres, using coordinates to plot locations.
3. Identify the state capital and describe the various regions of California, including how
their characteristics and physical environments (e.g., water, landforms, vegetation,
climate) affect human activity.
4. Identify the locations of the Pacific Ocean, rivers, valleys, and mountain passes and
explain their effects on the growth of towns.
5. Use maps, charts, and pictures to describe how communities in California vary in land
