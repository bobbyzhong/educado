5th Grade CA Common Core History: [
    United States History and Geography: Making a New Nation
Students in grade five study the development of the nation up to 1850, with an emphasis on the people who were already here, when and from where others arrived, and
why they came. Students learn about the colonial government founded on JudeoChristian principles, the ideals of the Enlightenment, and the English traditions of selfgovernment. They recognize that ours is a nation that has a constitution that derives its
power from the people, that has gone through a revolution, that once sanctioned slavery, that experienced conflict over land with the original inhabitants, and that experienced a westward movement that took its people across the continent. Studying the
cause, course, and consequences of the early explorations through the War for Independence and western expansion is central to students’ fundamental understanding of how
the principles of the American republic form the basis of a pluralistic society in which
individual rights are secured.
5.1	 Students describe the major pre-Columbian settlements, including the cliff
dwellers and pueblo people of the desert Southwest, the American Indians of
the Pacific Northwest, the nomadic nations of the Great Plains, and the woodland peoples east of the Mississippi River.
1.	 Describe how geography and climate influenced the way various nations lived and
adjusted to the natural environment, including locations of villages, the distinct structures
that they built, and how they obtained food, clothing, tools, and utensils.
2.	 Describe their varied customs and folklore traditions.
3.	 Explain their varied economies and systems of government.
