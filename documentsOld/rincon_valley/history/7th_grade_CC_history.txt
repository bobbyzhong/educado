7th Grade CA Common Core History: [
    World History and Geography:
Medieval and Early Modern Times
Students in grade seven study the social, cultural, and technological changes that occurred in Europe, Africa, and Asia in the years A.D. 500–1789. After reviewing the ancient world and the ways in which archaeologists and historians uncover the past,
students study the history and geography of great civilizations that were developing
concurrently throughout the world during medieval and early modern times. They
examine the growing economic interaction among civilizations as well as the exchange
of ideas, beliefs, technologies, and commodities. They learn about the resulting growth
of Enlightenment philosophy and the new examination of the concepts of reason and
authority, the natural rights of human beings and the divine right of kings, experimentalism in science, and the dogma of belief. Finally, students assess the political forces let
loose by the Enlightenment, particularly the rise of democratic ideas, and they learn
about the continuing influence of these ideas in the world today.
